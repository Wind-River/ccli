# Issues

## Recursive and forced delete are currently disabled to reduce delete times and protect wrongfull deletion of files. 
- Recursive delete can be done but results in an error even though the package is removed from the catalog since the files are not deleted.
- Forced delete is disabled on the backend completely and calling it acts similarly to a normal/recursive delete.
